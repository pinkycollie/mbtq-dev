## 2024-05-24 - Interactive List Items
**Learning:** Found an accessibility issue pattern where `<li>` elements had `onClick` handlers. These are not inherently keyboard focusable or operable by screen readers.
**Action:** When creating interactive lists, wrap the content in semantic `<button>` tags within the `<li>`. Use `w-full text-left` to maintain the block layout, add focus styles (`focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-x`), and include appropriate ARIA attributes like `aria-expanded`.
