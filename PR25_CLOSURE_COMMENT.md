## 🔄 VR Agency Platform Migration

This PR's excellent work on the VR agency platform features has been prepared for migration to a dedicated repository: **github.com/pinkycollie/vr4deaf**

### Why the Migration?

Separating the VR agency platform allows both projects to focus on their specific missions:

**mbtq-dev**: AI development platform for teaching and guiding developers to build full-stack applications
**vr4deaf**: Specialized VR agency platform for vocational rehabilitation agencies, LGBTQ+ organizations, and Deaf services providers

### What's Been Prepared

1. **Complete Migration Guide** - Step-by-step instructions in `MIGRATION_TO_VR4DEAF.md`
2. **Professional README** - Ready-to-use README for vr4deaf in `VR4DEAF_README.md`
3. **Cleanup Script** - Automated cleanup for mbtq-dev in `cleanup-mbtq-dev.sh`

### Files Moving to vr4deaf

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows (accessibility, security, deployment, release)
- ✅ Dashboard components (AgencyDashboard, AgencySelector, DashboardMetrics)
- ✅ Case management (CaseList)
- ✅ AI services (JobMatcher, EligibilityScreener, ReportGenerator)
- ✅ Database schema and VR-specific documentation

### Next Steps

1. Create `github.com/pinkycollie/vr4deaf` repository
2. Follow migration guide to copy files
3. Run cleanup script to restore mbtq-dev focus
4. Continue VR platform development in vr4deaf
